Refactored Syntastic:

This plugin checks syntax of your code (html, js, perl, ruby, ..) on buf write.
If errors are found they are shown in the location or quickfix list. The
location or quickfix window is opened and closed automatically.

The original version can be found here: git://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic.git.
Refactoring had to take place because
- I felt there was too much duplicaet code
- it was not customizable enough.

customizations:

Put into your .vimrc:

  call syntastic#Setup()
  " set this if you prefer activating the checkers manually
  " let g:syntastic['auto_setup'] = 0 
  let g:syntastic.file_types['new_type'] = Examples see plugin/syntastic.vim
  let g:syntastic.file_types['xml'] = 'disabled'

  " overwrite error format
  let g:syntastic.file_types['js'].cmd.efm = "overwrite error fromat here"

  " for html tidy set ignore regex
  let g:syntastic.file_types.html.ignore_regex = 'lacks "alt" attribute\|proprietary attribute'

Special notes:
  Some checkers such as xml / xhtml work best if you have local copies of the
  dtds. See comments

  syntax checkers should never execute code. If you want to do that use
  vim-addon-actions!
